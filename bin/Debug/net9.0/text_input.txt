I made this adjustment to her ult because I think it's healthier this way. This wasn't a data-driven decision pushed by someone else. This was informed by my experiences playing as and against Celeste. Again, we can disagree and see but please don't peddle a narrative that isn't true or snipe at my co-workers because it's convenient for what you want to believe. Good luck in your games.
